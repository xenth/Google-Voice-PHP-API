Google Voice PHP API
====================

An API to interact with Google Voice using PHP.

Currently the API can place calls, cancel previously placed calls, send and
receive SMS messages, add a note to or remove a note from a message or voicemail,
mark a message or voicemail as read or unread, and download transcriptions and/or
MP3 files of voicemail. Feel free to implement new functionality and send me your
changes so I can incorporate them into this library!


Interactive Testing Dashboard
=============================
Use gvTest.php to test all of the implemented methods (DO NOT UPLOAD gvTest.php
TO A PUBLIC WEB SERVER.) It is a great way to familiarize yourself with what
the "message" objects look like and to discover new fields that Google may 
introduce. Also, if the script breaks, gvTest makes it easier to track down
a reason.

General messaging methods
=========================
These methods can be used to affect all types of messages including voicemail, 
SMS and missed calls:

	addNote($messageId, $note)
  archive($messageId)
	delete($messageId)
  getInbox()
	markRead($messageId)
	markUnread($messageId)
	removeNote($messageId)
  unArchive($messageId)
  
"Call" Methods
==============
These methods are related to "calls" only:

	callNumber($number, $from_number, $phone_type = 'mobile')
	cancelCall($number, $from_number, $phone_type = 'mobile')
  getMissedCalls()

SMS methods
===========
Methods that act on SMS messages:

	getAllSMS()
	getNewSMS()
	getReadSMS()
	getUnreadSMS()
	sendSMS($number, $message)

Voicemail methods
=================
	getAllVoicemail()
	getReadVoicemail()
	getUnreadVoicemail()
	getVoicemailMP3($messageId)

Methods that don't work
=======================
  searchNumber($phoneNumber)

Debugging Methods
=================
	dom_dump($obj)
  getVals()

The "get" methods above all return an array of JSON "message" objects. Each object 
has the following attributes, example values included:

	$msg->id = c3716aa447a19c7e2e7347f443dd29091401ae13
	$msg->phoneNumber = +15555555555
	$msg->displayNumber = (555) 555-5555
	$msg->startTime = 1359918736555
	$msg->displayStartDateTime = 2/3/13 5:55 PM
	$msg->displayStartTime = 5:55 PM
	$msg->relativeStartTime = 5 hours ago
	$msg->note = 
	$msg->isRead = true
	$msg->isSpam = false
	$msg->isTrash = false
	$msg->star: = alse
	$msg->messageText = Hello, cellphone.
	$msg->labels = [sms,all]
	$msg->type = 11
	$msg->children =
